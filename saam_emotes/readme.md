Made by Saam.exe, (https://github.com/saamdotexe)
based on Jeva's simple emote command for fivem (https://github.com/jevajs/Jeva/tree/master/FiveM%20-%20Emotes%20(Tasks%20and%20Ped%20Scenarios)/emotes)
IMPORTANT: Please note that this is my very first script for RedM (even Fivem tbh), it's not polished, it works well but it's not perfect. As i learn more things this will receive updates.


## ▂▃▅▇█▓▒░  INSTALLATION  ░▒▓█▇▅▃▂

1) - Put the folder "saam_emotes" into your server resource folder.
